# Statistical Data Analysis App

## Overview

This enhanced Streamlit application offers a sophisticated platform for statistical data analysis. With a focus on sensor data, it provides interactive and detailed analyses, catering to both advanced users and those new to data analysis. The app now supports multi-page navigation, allowing users to focus on specific types of analyses separately, enhancing the user experience.

## Features

- **Advanced File Upload:** Supports TAR files containing CSVs, allowing for bulk data processing.
- **Multi-Page Navigation:** Each analysis type is hosted on a separate page, improving navigation and user focus.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis Techniques:** The application includes several sophisticated data analysis methods:
  - **Setting Acceptance Upper and Lower Limits:** Analyzes data within specified boundaries.
  - **Reporting Out of Boundary Data:** Identifies and reports data points that fall outside predefined limits.
  - **Trending Historical Data Analysis:** Investigates trends and patterns over time.
  - **Curve Fitting and RÂ² Calculation:** Performs curve fitting (linear, polynomial, exponential) and calculates the coefficient of determination.
  - **Step-Shift Adjustments:** Detects and adjusts for sudden changes or shifts in the data.
  - **Comparative Linear Regression Analysis:** Compares linear relationships between variables across different groups.
  - **3-Sigma Envelope Analysis:** Implements the 3-sigma rule for outlier detection in data.
  - **Cook's Distance Analysis:** Identifies influential points in regression analysis.
- **Enhanced Data Visualization:** Integrates Plotly for dynamic, interactive charts and graphs.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-navigate interface with clear options and interactive elements for a smooth user experience.
- **Streamlined Code Structure:** Code for each analysis is modularized and organized within the `utils` and for Pages in `page` directory, following best practices.
